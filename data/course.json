  "course_description": "Terrascope is a learning community for first-year students to solve complex, real-world problems starting in their first semester at MIT.\n\nAt the core of the Terrascope program is one basic but important idea: MIT students, even as first-year students, are ready to take control of their own education and to tackle big, important problems. With each new class of first-year students, Terrascope explores a different global issue\u2014and it\u2019s the students who take command. Our students work in teams to develop solutions, drawing on diverse perspectives, interdisciplinary research, and a supportive Terrascope community.\n\nIn recent years, Terrascope students have worked on topics like fresh water, food security, biodiversity, clean energy, and climate resilience.",
